## About

The Cryptopals challenges consist of 64 challenges that cover various cryptographic concepts. This repository includes solutions written in Rust, leveraging the power of the language for cryptography-related tasks like encoding, decoding, XOR operations, and more.

### Why Rust?

Rust is chosen for its:
- **Memory safety**: No need to worry about common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows.
- **Performance**: Ideal for computational-heavy tasks like cryptography.
- **Strong type system**: Ensures reliable and secure code.

## Challenges

- **Set 1**: Basics, Encoding, XOR, and Block Ciphers
- **Set 2**: Crypto 101 - Padding, ECB, CBC modes, and more.
- **Set 3**: Block & Stream Crypto
- **Set 4**: Stream Ciphers and randomness
- **Set 5**: Diffie-Hellman and friends
- **Set 6**: RSA and DSA
- **Set 7**: Hashes
- **Set 8**: Abstract Algebra
